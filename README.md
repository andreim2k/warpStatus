# WarpStatus - Warp Terminal AI Usage Monitor

A macOS menu bar application that displays your Warp terminal AI usage in real-time.

![WarpStatus Demo](demo.png)

## Features

- **Real-time Usage Display**: Shows current AI request usage (e.g., 224/2500) directly in the menu bar
- **Color-coded Status**: Green for healthy usage, orange for moderate, red for near limit
- **Subscription Type**: Displays your plan type (Free, Standard, Pro)
- **Progress Visualization**: Visual progress bar showing usage percentage
- **Real-time Updates**: Updates every second for instant usage tracking
- **Manual Refresh**: Click to refresh usage data instantly
- **Reset Timer**: Shows when your usage limit will reset

## How it Works

WarpStatus monitors your Warp AI usage in real-time by reading from Warp's local preferences file (`~/Library/Preferences/dev.warp.Warp-Stable.plist`). It updates every second to show instant changes when you use AI features, displaying this information in an easy-to-read menu bar format.
